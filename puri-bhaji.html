            <h2>About Puri Bhaji</h2>
            <p>Puri Bhaji is a popular Indian dish consisting of deep-fried bread called puri, served with a spiced potato curry known as bhaji. The puris are made from a dough of wheat flour, salt, and water, which is then rolled into discs and deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The bhaji is made by cooking potatoes with a blend of spices, onions, tomatoes, and green chilies to create a flavorful, hearty accompaniment. This dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast or brunch item in many parts of India.</p>
